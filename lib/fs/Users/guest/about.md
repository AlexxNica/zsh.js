# About me

I'm a Software Engineer, currently working at Facebook, in the React Native
Performance team.  When I'm not working I like to learn about and play with
Compilers and Low Level Programming.

# About this website

I wanted something more than a boring portfolio, so I thought it'd be cool to
write a copy of my terminal setup in JavaScript. The bits of it that I managed
to implement look exactly like what I'm using on my development machine.

# Commands

If you want to know more about me, there are a few commands:
  * about  (currently running)
  * contact 
  * resume
  * projects

For the terminal commands you can use `help` to list all the available commands.

# Tmux is also available!

The prefix is the default (C-b) which means that you have to press ctrl+b before
any tmux command.
The following commands are available:
  * c - create a new window
  * h or left - switch to previous window
  * l or right - switch to next window
  * q - close current window

I hope you have as much fun playing with the terminal as I had building it :)
