* About me
  I'm a Software Engineer at Facebook, working in the React Native Performance team.
  I'm really passionate about Compilers and Low Level Programming

* About this website
  I wanted something more than a boring portfolio, so I thought it'd be cool to write
  a copy of my terminal setup in JavaScript. The bits of it that I manage to implement
  look exactly like what I'm using on my development machine.

* Commands
  If you want to know more about me, there are a few commands:
    * about  (currently running)
    * contact 
    * resume
    * projects
    * help (shows all the available terminal commands)
    
* Tmux is also available!
  The prefix is the default (C-b) which means that you have to press ctrl+b before
  any tmux command.
  The following commands are available:
    * c - create a new window
    * h or left - switch to previous window
    * l or right - switch to next window
    * q - close current window

Hope you have as much fun as I had building it :)
