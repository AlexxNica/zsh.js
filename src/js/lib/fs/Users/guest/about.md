* About me
  I'm a Mobile developer, C++ passionate, JS fan, Ruby something and Game Development enthusiast,
  Always willing to contribute to open source projects and trying to learn some more math.

* About this website
  I wanted more than just show my work, I wanted to show my work environment.
  As a mobile I also use (sadly) some IDEs, but always trying to do as much as I can on this terminal, so I made a very
  similar copy (at least visually speaking) of it so people could get to see what I do and how I (usually) do.

* Commands
  If you want to know about me, there are a few commands:
    * about  (currently running)
    * contact 
    * resume
    * projects

  If you need some help about the terminal, or want to know what functionalities are currrently implemented, type `help` any time.

Hope you have as much fun as I had doing it :)
